    "On 4th May 2020, Saudi Arabia was struck by a deadly virus called the coronavirus also known by its scientific name 'covid-19'. and on the 9th of September 2020, the recovery rate in Saudi Arabia has increased dramatically because of the new-normal systems. social distancing has changed many methods for many businesses, especially for restaurants. Since things are slowly going back to normal, finding a perfect location to open up a new restaurant would be a good idea. Finding a perfect location requires various factors that data scientists need to consider and process, as well as all of the access of data information around the neighbourhood. In this report, I will be describing a simple analysis of data from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia city neighbourhood to find a a decent location to open up a new restaurant."
